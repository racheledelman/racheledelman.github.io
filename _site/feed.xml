&lt;h2 id=&quot;research&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/reqcheck-participatory-design.png&quot; alt=&quot;Making a journey map with the nurses&quot; /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Leading a participatory design exercise with front-line Health Department staff.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with research. My team identified three major stakeholders: parents, health department employees, and the broader Kansas City health community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/images/reqcheck-journey-map.png&quot; class=&quot;inline-thumb&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/images/thumbs/reqcheck-map-thumb.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used a variety of techniques to learn about these groups: stakeholder interviews, shadowing, intercept interviews, and participatory design exercises. I wrote scripts, recruited participants, and conducted interviews. I then synthesized this research to present key insights to team members, funders, and other stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this process, we identified pain points and bottlenecks. We decided to focus on two issues where we knew we could have a significant impact. First, that there was no way to triage families at intake, and second that vaccine records were difficult to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;design&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our solution was ReqCheck: a web app running an algorithm built on top of vaccine requirements from the Centers for Disease Control. The app pulls data from the Health Department’s electronic health records, and determines if a patient is up to date on their vaccines. With our app, registration staff can triage without consulting a nurse, and nurses can make decisions faster and more accurately. This significantly streamlines the clinic’s work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I think it’s clean and organized. It’s not confusing, because everything’s right where it needs to be. It looks user friendly.” - Immunization Clinic nurse&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/reqcheck-patient.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of ReqCheck’s patient record screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;records&quot;&gt;Records&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/reqcheck-old-records.png&quot; alt=&quot;Previous design of vaccine records&quot; /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;The vaccine records the Health Department was using required the nurses to do unnecessary math.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app includes vaccines records for each patient. Previously, they were presented in a hard to read format and didn’t include all relevant data. The redesigned vaccine records are quicker and easier to interpret. Nurses can work more efficiently, with fewer errors. Grouping entries logically allows the reader to quickly scan the chart and determine if a patient is up to date. Nurses previously had to count on their fingers to check date and time frames. Now those calculations are displayed right on the record. The less time nurses spend doing math, the more time they have to counsel patients and provide care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/reqcheck-new-records.png&quot; alt=&quot;Redesigned digital records&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immunizations don’t just keep kids healthy. They’re also a requirement for enrolling in school. A printed version can also be shared with parents, schools, and other medical providers. Vaccine records are complex documents, but non-specialists often need to interpret them. The new designs let everyone make sense of the data they need to help keep kids healthy and in school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;form-redesign&quot;&gt;Form Redesign&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forms are a major point of interaction between clients and the Health Department. A redesign of the clinic’s intake paperwork represented a huge opportunity to save time, reduce errors, and improve service delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with an audit of the current paperwork. The system in place involved forms created by different entities, leading to a fragmented experience. I found lots of repetition. Patients were being asked the same questions over and over again. There was also conflicting information, and a different visual style from form to form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/forms-question-audit.png&quot; alt=&quot;Question audit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;small&gt;I collected the intake forms and tallied how many times each question was asked.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used this data, as well as information gathered through observing and interviewing staff and clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I completed a total redesign of the four main intake forms, as well as creating a new form for the &lt;a href=&quot;/fellowship/2016/10/10/client-outreach.html&quot;&gt;text message outreach program&lt;/a&gt;. The new forms feature condensed questions and simplified language. I also created a consistent, easy to read visual design system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project kicked off an &lt;a href=&quot;/fellowship/2016/10/09/DesignEducations.html&quot;&gt;enduring interest&lt;/a&gt; in form design. At its root, the purpose of design is to help people understand information. I usually approach this from a visual or interactive standpoint, but language is also a huge component. I love to transform complex ideas and bureaucratic language into simple, natural writing. Pairing this with beautiful, easy to use inputs can make a huge difference in how people interact with institutions.

&lt;small&gt;Paper prototypes for content testing with users.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For busy parents who don’t have a primary care provider, keeping on top of immunizations can be hard. We wanted to meet people where they were, using technology they were comfortable with. We decided to implement an outreach campaign to send text message reminders and alerts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First came research. I intercepted parents in the health department lobby and at a nearby preschool. I interviewed them about their routines, their relationship with the health department, and their usage of text messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used that research to write a variety of text messages. The challenge was to craft clear, HIPAA compliant messages that fit the size constraints of a text message. I then tested the message content with parents to make sure the content made sense to recipients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the text messages I wrote, we ran a number of pilot programs. We sent over 10,000 text messages. The promising results convinced us that the Health Department should be sending regular vaccine reminders by text message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“[The messages] remind me to go early rather than leaving it to the last minute like I did last year.” - A KCHD client&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;staff-training&quot;&gt;Staff training&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conduct our text message campaigns, we used two off the shelf products, Twilio and TextIt. Because the Health Department has limited technical resources, it was important to ensure a non-technical person could take over the outreach program. To that end, we decided to document the entire process. We also wanted to create a resource that would be helpful to wider public health community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put together a website, and with my team, wrote an extensive tutorial. The website includes instructions on implementation, as well as advice on best practices. We hope it will be a resource not only for the Kansas City Health Department, but also other public health organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
