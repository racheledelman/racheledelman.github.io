# Form Redesign

Forms are a major point of interaction between clients and the Health Department. A redesign of the clinic's intake paperwork represented a huge opportunity to save time, reduce errors, and improve service delivery.

I started with an audit of the current paperwork. The system in place involved forms created by different entities, leading to a fragmented experience. I found lots of repetition. Patients were being asked the same questions over and over again. There was also conflicting information, and a different visual style from form to form.

I used this data, as well as information gathered through observing and interviewing staff and clients.

I completed a total redesign of the four main intake forms, as well as creating a new form for the [text message outreach program]({% post_url 2016-10-10-client-outreach %}). The new forms feature condensed questions and simplified language. I also created a consistent, easy to read visual design system.

# Forms forever

This project kicked off an [enduring interest]({% post_url 2016-10-09-DesignEducations %}) in form design. At its root, the purpose of design is to help people understand information. I usually approach this from a visual or interactive standpoint, but language is also a huge component. I love to transform complex ideas and bureaucratic language into simple, natural writing. Pairing this with beautiful, easy to use inputs can make a huge difference in how people interact with institutions. Forms!
