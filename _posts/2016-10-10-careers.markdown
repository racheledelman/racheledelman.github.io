Design for a careers microsite. This site has to list content, but also sell it. A large number of listings targeting a wide variety of job seekers necessitates multiple forms of navigation.

In addition to searching by office and department, featured listings are highlighted. Bright graphics keep the page from being too text heavy. Profiles of employees bring a human touch.

Responsive design reaches the user wherever they are. The site was designed mobile first.
