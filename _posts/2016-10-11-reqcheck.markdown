ReqCheck is a lightweight web app that interprets vaccine records. 

## Research

I started with research. My team identified three major stakeholders: parents, health department employees, and the broader Kansas City health community.

I used a variety of techniques to learn about these groups: stakeholder interviews, shadowing, intercept interviews, and participatory design exercises. I wrote scripts, recruited participants, and conducted interviews. I then synthesized this research to present key insights to team members, funders, and other stakeholders.


During this process, we identified multiple pain points and bottlenecks. We decided to focus on two issues where we knew we could have a significant impact. The first was that there was no way to triage families at intake, and the second was that vaccine records were difficult to read.

## Design

Our solution was ReqCheck: a web app running an algorithm built on top of vaccine requirements from the Center for Disease Control. The app pulls data from the Health Department's electronic health records, and determines if a patient is up to date on their vaccines. Registration staff can triage without consulting a nurse, and nurses can make decisions faster and more accurately. This  will significantly streamline the clinic's work.

### Records

The app includes vaccines records for each patient. While nurses previously had access to this data, it was presented in a hard to read format and didn't include all relevant data. The redesigned vaccine records are quicker and easier to interpret. This allows the nurses to work more efficiently, and reduces errors. The logically grouped entries allow the reader to quickly scan the chart and determine if a patient is up to date. Nurses previously had to count on their fingers to check date and time frames. Now those calculations are displayed right on the chart. The less time nurses spend doing math, the more time they have to counsel patients and provide care.

A printed version can also be shared with parents, schools, and other medical providers. Vaccine records are complex documents, but non-specialists often need to reference them. This design helps them make sense of the data and easily see which vaccines a child has or has not received.
