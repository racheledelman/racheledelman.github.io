I have had an number of exciting opportunities to run workshops, give talks, and develop educational materials. I enjoy introducing others to human centered design and helping them discover their creative potential.

## Design for Non-Designers

This workshop is a one hour introduction to design basics, with a focus on user interface design. It covers principles and techniques and includes several hands on activities. 

I have run it at the 2016 National Day of Civic Hacking, for the the User Experience graduate students at Missouri Western State University, and for City employees in San Diego.

## Form Design for Government

I prepared this talk for Data Academy, Kansas Cityâ€™s internal data bootcamp for government employees. It was informed by my [intake form redesign project]({% post_url 2016-10-10-forms %}).

> "Made the concepts easy to understand and provided relevant examples. Created a comfortable and welcoming environment in which to discuss data and related projects." - Workshop participant

## Designing a Government System in a Day

Along with two other Fellows, I ran this breakout session at the 2016 Code for America Summit. We showed how design sprints can be used in civic technology, focusing on strategy, innovation, and prototyping.
