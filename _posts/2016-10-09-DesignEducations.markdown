I have had an number of exciting opportunities to run workshops, give talks, and develop educational materials. I enjoy introducing others to human centered design and helping them discover their creative potential.

## Design for Non-Designers workshop

This workshop is a one hour introduction to design basics, with a focus on user interface design. It covers principles and techniques and includes several hands on activities. 

I have run it at the 2016 National Day of Civic Hacking, for the the User Experience graduate students at Missouri Western State University, and for City employees in San Diego.

## Form Design for Government talk

I prepared this talk for Data Academy, Kansas Cityâ€™s internal data bootcamp for government employees. It was informed by my [intake form redesign project]({% post_url 2016-10-10-forms %}).
