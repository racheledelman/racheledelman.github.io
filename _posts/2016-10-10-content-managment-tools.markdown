## Moderation Interface
Design for an interface where moderators can view, edit, and promote user submitted content. Through observing moderators work with the previous version of this tool, I was able to identify inefficient and confusing patterns and introduce solutions.

My process includes observation, documentation, iteration, and usability testing.
