I'm a designer based in San Francisco.

I have a BFA in graphic design from [Purchase College, State University of New York](https://www.purchase.edu/). I took classes in book binding and letterpress, and spent a lot of time on the internet, so that worked out. I'm interested in public interest design, civic technology, and usability, which lead me to become a Code for America [Fellow](https://www.codeforamerica.org/do-something/work-with-us) in 2016.

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/racheledelman) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-edelman-aa530488/).
